# 20Time-ICS4U - Excel Converter
This log keeps track of the progress made on my 20 time project from 

# Week 1 (Sept 18 - Sept 24)
- Waiting for project from Mrs. Kirby
- Doing research on excel coding languages

# Week 2 (Sept 25 - Oct 1)
- Made proper 20 time log format
- Talked to guidance to recive project info
- Project will be reformatting an excel file 

# Week 3 (Oct 2 - Oct 8)
- researching and learning apache.pio 
- Alex is working on GUI

# Week 4 (Oct 9 - Oct 15)
- Learning differnt aspects of Apache
- Intriciate process, require lots of time to learn
- Watching online tutorials

# Week 5 (Oct 16 - Oct 22)
- Trying example documents local computer   
- Links I have used for tutorials:
    - https://www.journaldev.com/2562/apache-poi-tutorial
    - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_poi/
# Week 6 (Oct 23 - Oct 29)
- Having trouble with a few small aspects
- Have not had much progres in general due to limited time. Focusing efforts on Nature of Code currently

# Week 7 (Oct 30 - Nov 5)
- 20 time project got sideline by having to go back and complete Javascript challenges, along with HTML
- Have plans to implement more features

# Week 8 (Nov 6 - Nov 12)
- Nature of code has taken all my time
- No time to work on 20 time. Considering changing topics to reflect my passion of engineering. 

# Week 9 (Nov 13 - Nov 19)
- Changed topic to a bicicle powered charger. Starting to research and experiment with different designs. 
- Right now in the stages of finding the msot efficient power extraction method. 

# Week 10 (Nov 20 - Nov 26)
- Prototype created, testing to make sure it works
- Went through two designs
    - one with the motor attached to the chain. I found this did not work, as when I stopped peddaling, it stopped charging the phone
    - Second one is a rubber attachemement connected to the wheel. This way the only time it would stop charging was if the bike stopped        moving or it was going extremley slow.
- used a car charger, and wired it to the motor. This gives a stable power flow with no fluctuations. 

# Week 11 (Nov 27 - Dec 3)
- Changed topic to a bicicle powered charger. Starting to research and experiment with different designs. 
- Right now in the stages of finding the msot efficient power extraction method. 

# Week 12 (Nov 4 - Dec 10)
- Created a video explaining my thought proccess for creating the pwoer eficient charger
- edited and filmed within two days, happy with the turn out.
